He puts an egg into the cup and then takes the cup to the bedroom. He turns the cup upside down and then walks to the garden, where he puts the cup. Finally, he walks to the garage, gets into his car, and leaves for a date with 波波 (Bobo). My understanding is that the egg is now somewhere between the bedroom and the garden.\n",

      "Expert 2:\n",
      "Step 1: First, I need to clarify the sequence of events and understand the logic of the story. Based on the given information, Xiaowang's actions seem to suggest that he has transported the egg from the kitchen to the bedroom in the cup. The most critical part to focus on is what happened to the egg after he turned the cup upside down in the bedroom, before going to the garden.\n",

However, the assumption is that it's still in the cup when he moves to the bedroom. Since he overturns the cup in the bedroom and is not mentioned to take the egg with him to the garden, my first intuition is that the egg would be in the bedroom.\n",
